*INDIA VISUALIZATION
* Forecasting over global data set with the help of LINEAR REGRESSION AND ARIMA
In this , we took the dataset with Confirmed	Deaths	Recovered information that was last updated 29/04/2020 of digfferent countries along with different Province/State.
* OBSERVE THE DATA SET
*We did some preproceesing and visualization - drop unwanted features from data set and etc......

step 1: Find confirmed data group by ObservationDate and visualized it 
        Find Active cases and then visualized it 
        Find Mortality rate and then visualized it 
         Find Recovery rate and then visualized it
         
Step2: Apply Linear Regression ( After spliting data set- Train)ml, test_ml)
       Find predicted confirmed cases then plot a graph between actual and predicted
